A 3D Platformer test game for Godot

This is a 3D platformer test game for Godot that I, SolarLune, work on from time to time live on my YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/c/solarlune

Feel free to stop by - I tend to stream weekly on Sunday afternoons, but it's not only game-dev with Godot.

Anyway, I'm uploading the current state of this little project as a learning resource. Feel free to check it out, but PLEASE do not use any of the assets (specifically Pop himself) in a commercial or donation-driven project. That includes Patreon, haha.

Thanks!
